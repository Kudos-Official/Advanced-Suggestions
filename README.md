[here](https://discord.gg/VkZcRRUXpU), and no, you only test bots, its not a formal server, its so casual that none will bother welcoming you since you just got 2 channels(rules and testing), and people who I know get admin, I used to give it to everyone but since its in a repo people will join and might abuse shit, so yes. Abooz = Ban
